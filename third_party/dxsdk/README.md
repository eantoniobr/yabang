This is the version of the DirectX 9 SDK currently used by Yabang. It is not available through official channels anymore, so it is reproduced here.

It should probably be removed in the future, either by using Direct3D directly skipping the SDK, or by moving Yabang off of old D3D9 (to either more modern D3D9, or emulation of D3D9 on a more modern platform, or perhaps both.)
